abstract = "Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is a research field where the role played by individuals as members of groups is fundamental. The human being is not considered as an individual entity, but it is considered as a being embedded into the society, where he works and interacts. From the beginning, many CSCW systems have arisen. Some taxonomies appeared in order to find a way to classify all these tools, but they have become more and more complicated, therefore nowadays such classifications cannot sort them correctly. In this paper we present a taxonomy according to these changes, so that CSCW systems can be classified in a more flexible way."
